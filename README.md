# Incident-Asset-Management---AppGyver
My participation in the No-Code Challenge is described in this blog post. If you’re not familiar with the challenge, please read Daniel Wroblewski blog article for more information. But, in short, it’s an opportunity to learn more about SAP AppGyver and share what you’ve created with the SAP Community.  My goal was to build a mobile app that will be more like Incident Management App where we can raise an incident or withdraw the incident. Similar to that, I wanted to have asset compliance so that by scanning the asset we can see the details of the asset.
